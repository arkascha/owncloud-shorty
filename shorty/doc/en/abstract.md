# Abstract
-----

The Shorty app offers a service to store, manage and use a collection of shortened links pointing to different resources in the web. The features are a combination of a centralized bookmarks collection, an URL shortener and basic access control.


A new entry, called "Shorty", can be created either manually by entering a URL ("New shorty") or by simply clicking the "Shortlet" whenever you visit a page you want to share. The "Shortlet" is something like a bookmarklet, a script based bookmark meant to be stored inside the bookmark area of your web browser. When clicked, the currently open page will be added to your collection of Shortys, including a practical shortened URL.


Each Shorty contains a source and a target URL. The source URL can be used to be posted in forums, sent by email or whatever. It is typically much shorter than the full blown target URL on the, though this might depend on the shortening service youÂ´re using as a "backend". Basic access control is implemented to control access to the Shortys, but not per user or per group. Existing Shortys can be blocked entirely, set to expire on a certain date and of course they can be removed again.
