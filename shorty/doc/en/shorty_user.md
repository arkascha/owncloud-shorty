# Shorty UserÂ´s Guide
-----

## Usage
This is only a very basic description. The plugin should be fairly intuitive to use, just have a try with a few URLs on the web. To get going I suggest that you  

* import the "Shortlet" into your preferred web browser (see below).  
* define a few shorties either manually ("New Shorty") or by using the Shortlet.  


All actions on existing shorties are accessed using the action icons shown to the right of any Shorty in the list. Daily use is probably based on selecting the 'share' action and grabbing the visualized "source url".


By clicking on the header row of the list you can open (and close) a "toolbox" offering options to sort, filter and reload the list. The active sorting order is stored in a persistent manner, but any filters will not be stored. You cannot accidentially close the toolbox when filters are still activated.


You can remove (delete) existing shorties, but these will only be marked for deletion. This way you can 'undelete' them if required. The actual removal will be done the next time you access the shorty plugin. If you want to make sure the removal is done immediately then simply reload the list. This is done in the "toolbox" (click on the header row) by chosing the "reload" icon on the left (or by simply reloading the page).

## PRIVACY
Shorty allows you to stay more in control over links you post or send. It is up to you to decide whether a posted link should stay valid and usable or not.


However it is also very important to keep in mind that such form of control can never replace any serious access control over the content published via a published link. Shorty works as a short-URL resolver, meaning it forwards requests by web browsers to the real address ("target") of the published content. This might change in the future when (if) a proxy function gets implemented, as opposed to the current forwarding mechanism.
